# MDR Research

*At [MDR Research](https://mdrresearch.co.uk/), lawyers, engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and technologists work side-by-side to advance the frontier of legal systems understanding.*  

*Our core focus is the intersection of new technologies and techniques that explore, support and advance understanding of legal reasoning, the delivery of legal services and access to justice and legal information.*

*We are interested in the application of machine learning, analytics, systems modelling, distributed systems design, governance and the emerging field of computational law (complaw) â€” the branch of legal informatics concerned with the mechanisation of legal reasoning.*
