# *“Does judicial review strike the right balance between enabling citizens to challenge the lawfulness of government action and allowing the executive and local authorities to carry on the business of government?”*

### Abstract

Mishcon de Reya LLP (“Mishcon”/ the “Firm”) is a dynamic and diverse London based law firm that has recently acted in two of the most prominent judicial review cases in memory: R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] (“Miller 1”) and R (Miller) v The Prime Minister [2019] (“Miller 2”). It has been widely speculated that these cases acted as a catalyst for the current Consultation1 with critics of Miller 2 in particular arguing that the court overstepped its judicial boundaries in deciding that the Prime Minister had acted unlawfully when he advised the Queen to prorogue Parliament in August 2019. The Firm disagrees with this assessment, and is of the view that judicial review is an indispensable element of the system of checks and balances that govern our democratic society and that there is no evidential basis necessitating reform of the system. This conclusion is based on three separate sources of information: first, this Firm’s breadth of experience in advising on judicial review cases; second, data analysis which this Firm has undertaken to prepare this response; and third, a comparative assessment of judicial review in Australia and the United States of America. 

In relation to our experience, aside from the Firm’s involvement in the Miller cases, it has represented applicants, respondents and interested parties across a wide range of sectors reviewing the decisions of regulators, local authorities and Government Departments. Notably, the Firm defended the rights of child immigrants, advising the Project for Registration of Children as British Citizens in its successful challenge to the Home Office in relation to the fees charged to process children’s visa applications.2 Other cases which highlight the breadth of the Firm’s experience include acting for: a property developer in resisting a judicial review of a planning permission decision; an interested party in resisting judicial review proceedings being brought against the DPP; a firm of solicitors in reviewing the decision of a Recorder in the County Court;3 and acting in successful judicial review proceedings brought in the BVI. The Firm also has experience of settling judicial review cases before they reach the hearing stage. Given the diverse nature of Mishcon’s involvement in judicial review cases, from issues of immigration and human rights to planning, we believe that we are well qualified to comment on the fitness of the current system in relation to the question posed by this consultation. 

As to data analysis, in partnership with vLex Justis, through access to published judgments from the Queen’s Bench Division, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court over the past ten years, we have analysed the data for trends in judicial review. 

On the basis of the above sources of information, we believe that judicial review is an essential element in the makeup and sustainability of the rule of law in this country. As the panel will be more than aware, the rule of law is known to be one of the “twin pillars of the UK constitution” along with Parliamentary Sovereignty - a key facet of which (as described by AV Dicey) is Government limited by established laws.5 It is our view that any steps taken to limit the powers of the judiciary to scrutinise decisions of the Executive will be anathema to the fundamental constitutional law principle of the rule of law and may erode the constitutional basis of the entire democratic system. We expand upon this assessment in our responses to the consultation set out below.
