# Oraclised Data Schemas: Improving contractual certainty in uncertain times

### Abstract

The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government restrictions to individuals and selected business sectors has caused unprecedented interruptions and uncertainty. The scale of this disruption is manifest in the changes in GDP figures. According to the Office of National Statistics, the UK GDP fell by 20.4\percent in April 2020, which is in line with the predictions of the OECD for advanced economies. The OECD predicted the overall direct initial hit in many major advanced economiesâ€™ GDP to be between 20-25\percent. This has had serious financial consequences not only for the affected sectors, but also the firms that insure and underwrite different types of economic activity. 

Furthermore, as current restrictions are lifted in response to reduced infection risks and changing policy, there is a need for parties to be able to enter into agreements where the trading environment may be subject to rapid change. If a sector is restricted again in response to changing infection rates, it may be necessary for contracts to explicitly deal with temporal conditions that are applicable at local or regional level. Examples might include a commercial lease based on turnover or a service level agreement based on supply of goods restricted by closing a manufacturing facility. 

In this paper, we set out an approach to adaptable contract clauses based on different data sources. Our approach uses i) an oracle to serve data from designated sources relating to COVID-19 and the trading restrictions that are in force ii) a schema to represent the data structures and a methods for parsing the data, and iii) a legal lexicon for integration into smart contracts. In combination, these can be used to develop dynamic legal agreements that can adapt to black swan events such as pandemic and a range of dynamic regulatory restrictions. This paper presents details of our implementation of an oricalised data schema and discusses future developments of the system.
