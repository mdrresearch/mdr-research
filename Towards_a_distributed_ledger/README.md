### Abstract

On the 6 March 2019 the sale of a recently refurbished, semi- detached house in Gillingham had completed. The conveyance process had taken 22 weeks to complete against an initial estimate of six weeks. Together with HM Land Registry’s (HMLR) Digital Street (and a consor tium of other par ties set out at Section VII), we set out to explore how new technologies might improve the conveyance process.

We built a distributed ledger technology (DLT) based prototype that would enable a digital transfer of the property that automatically updates the Land Register. The term DLT refers to a broad umbrella of technologies that seek to store, synchronise and maintain digital records across a network of computing centres – see Section III for an introduction to DLT systems.

The HMLR implementation involved the creation of a DLT-based application, built on Corda, using a simplified number of transaction nodes.

The system was distributed, though HMLR retained an important role in the process by providing the single source of truth for the system to rely on when determining land title ownership for the purposes of the conveyance from time to time – see Section IV for an overview of the Digital Street project.

The project was a success – our DLT-based proof of concept took the same transaction that had taken 22 weeks to complete, and ran it through, end to end, in less than 10 minutes. Eddie Davies, Deputy Director of Digital Services at HMLR, has subsequently said that “[DLT] should be invisible to citizens and I think what it will mean for them is a home buying process that is more straight forward, easier and less full of stress. It’s an emerging technology that offers a good opportunity for the industry to explore further.”

The conveyance process is merely one (albeit significant and impactful) possible application of DLT within the real estate sector. It is likely that in the future several DLT systems will span the life-cycle of real estate assets, each of which will possess a degree of interoperability – see Section V for a high-level exploration of some of the other possible applications of DLT to the real estate sector that we are working on.

Although DLT holds great promise for application in the real estate sector, there remain several barriers to entry. These include a lack of awareness, certain technical limitations and issues, and what has been perceived as a lack of legal and regulatory clarity – see Section VI for an examination of these barriers and the steps that have been and are being taken to mitigate them.
